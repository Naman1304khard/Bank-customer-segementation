# Bank-customer-segmentation
This project applies RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) Analysis to segment bank customers based on their transaction behavior.
By classifying customers into groups such as Champions, Loyal Customers, Potential Loyalists, and At Risk, banks can make data-driven decisions for customer retention, cross-selling, and targeted marketing campaigns.

## Methodology

Data Cleaning → Converted dates, handled missing values.

RFM Metrics

Recency: Days since last transaction.

Frequency: Number of transactions.

Monetary: Total spending by customer.

Scoring System → Assigned scores (1–5) using quantiles.

Customer Segmentation → Categorized into:

Champions – Recent, frequent, and high spenders.

Loyal Customers – Frequent buyers with good spending.

Potential Loyalists – Show promise but need nurturing.

At Risk – Haven’t transacted recently.

Visualization → Segment distribution, scatter plots, revenue contribution.
